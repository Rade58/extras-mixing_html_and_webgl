# Extra Workshops: Mixing HTML and WebGL

Going to create one HTML point and add the other ones at the end

We will define that if we hover on certain point of the elemnt a text shows up with a description of the part of the elemnt

look at `src/index.html` and `src/global.css` to see what I have done
